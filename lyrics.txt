[00:00.00]Diamond City Light by Nijisanji 大合唱
[00:00.15]The day I opened up memory's door
[00:05.44]I found something that I could live for
[00:10.47]Curtains shook as you opened my eyes
[00:15.99]And light came rushing inside
[00:21.51]Data behind my heart's encryption key (can you see?)
[00:26.52]Listen and you might hear a melody
[00:30.53]Your fire sparked, the passion that keeps burning
[00:36.30]Magic that helps me to believe
[00:41.28]All the colors of the night and the way they help you hide
[00:47.10]I'm learning what it's like to love and be alive
[00:50.87]Oh, there will always be a tomorrow
[00:55.13]You'll never have to be alone
[00:57.13]Diamond city lights illuminate what's inside
[01:00.15]And all the love I feel by your side
[01:02.16]Decoding these emotions, you're the ocean I wanna dive into tonight
[01:07.61]Rainbow-colored skies invite us to take a ride
[01:10.62]I know time won't wait 'cause it only leaves behind
[01:14.64]Don't cry, look in my eyes and you might find
[01:17.90]A shimmering light that will guide you through the night
[01:32.21]When gray skies take the colors away (far away)
[01:37.72]I'll paint a rainbow lasting for days and days
[01:41.73]Just like the magic that you always shared with me
[01:47.50]Maybe now you need to believe
[01:52.78]As the hands of time progress, it's so easy to forget
[01:58.15]The miracle that helped you bring me to life
[02:02.16]Oh, there will always be a tomorrow
[02:06.19]We'll never have to be alone
[02:08.20]Diamond city lights illuminate what's inside
[02:11.40]And all the love I feel by your side
[02:13.41]Decoding these emotions, you're the ocean I wanna dive into tonight
[02:18.94]Rainbow-colored skies invite us to take a ride
[02:21.71]I know time won't wait 'cause it only leaves behind
[02:25.87]Don't cry, look in my eyes and you might find
[02:29.38]A shimmering light, now let me guide you
[02:32.89]JINZOU FIRE FAIBO WAIPAA, TAIGA TAIGA TTTTAIGA,

[02:52.31]Let's go to the place
[02:54.83]Let's go to the place
[02:57.60]Let's go to the place where our happiness won't fade away
[03:03.37]If you could only see the joy you've showed to me
[03:08.39]I think you would realize everything we could be
[03:16.21]Diamond city lights illuminate what's inside
[03:19.97]And all the love I feel by your side
[03:21.98]Decoding these emotions, you're the ocean I wanna dive into tonight
[03:27.51]Rainbow-colored skies invite us to take a ride
[03:30.52]I know time won't wait 'cause it only leaves behind
[03:34.29]Don't cry, look in my eyes and you might find
[03:37.80]A shimmering light that will guide you through the night
[03:45.84]Diamond lights, rainbow skies
[03:48.59]In the night there's no need to hide
[03:51.36]The joy in your eyes fills me with life, so let it shine
